# FashionMNIST Clothing Classifier ðŸ‘šðŸ‘–

This is a PyTorch-based image classification project using the FashionMNIST dataset. It trains a simple neural network to classify grayscale images of clothing into 10 categories.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains training, evaluation, and prediction scripts
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory work with Jupyter Notebooks
- `models/`: Where trained models are saved
- `data/`: Automatically handled by `torchvision.datasets`
- `.gitignore`: Ignores unnecessary files
- `requirements.txt`: Required packages

## Run the Training
```bash
python src/train.py
# fashionmnist-classifier
